## **1. User Registration with Roles (Guest, Host, Admin)**

### **Feature Overview:**

4. **Role:**

   - Default is `Guest` if no role is provided.
   - **Important:** Only an **Admin** can assign the `Admin` role.

---

  ```

---

### **Database Schema for User Registration:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('Guest', 'Host', 'Admin') DEFAULT 'Guest',
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

### **Role-Based Access Control:**

- **Guest:**  
   - Default role for users who simply register to browse, book properties, and manage their profile.
   - Permissions: View properties, make bookings, update profile.

- **Host:**  
   - Can list properties, manage their own property bookings, and view income reports.
   - Permissions: List properties, manage bookings, view host-specific analytics.

- **Admin:**  
   - Can manage all users, properties, and bookings across the platform.
   - Permissions: Create/edit users, assign roles (including Admin), manage all properties and bookings.

---

#### **Input Example:**

```json
{
  "userId": "12345",

```

#### **Output Example (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Role successfully updated to Host for user 12345."

  {
    "error": "Only an Admin can assign roles."
  }
  ```

- **Role assignment response time:**  
   - Assigning or updating a role for an existing user should be completed within **200ms** for up to **1000 concurrent requests**.

---

### **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- **Duplicate Email Registration:**  
   - The system should handle duplicate email attempts by providing a helpful error message (`"Email already registered. Please login or reset your password."`).
   
- **Password Complexity:**  
   - If the password doesnâ€™t meet the specified complexity requirements, the system should reject the registration request and inform the user with the error message `"Password must include at least 8 characters, one uppercase, one special character, and one number."`

- **Role-based Restrictions:**  
   - **Unauthorized Role Assignment:** If a non-Admin user attempts to assign the `Admin` role, the system should respond with `"You do not have permission to assign the Admin role."`
   - **Admin Role:** The `Admin` role can only be assigned via the Admin interface. Only the existing **Admin** can assign this role.

- **Email Verification Failure:**  
   - If the email verification link expires or is invalid, return an error message:  
     ```json
     {
       "error": "Email verification failed or link expired. Please request a new verification email."
     }
     ```
